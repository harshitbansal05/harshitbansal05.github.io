<div class="discTxt contentBox"><h2>How to choose the best Credit Card?</h2><br/><div class="moreCont"><p>The best way to choose your credit card depends on understanding your spending pattern in terms of where you spend the most of your income, and where you are likely to spend more. Is it shopping, dining, entertainment,
                                        fuel, travel or a combination of these categories? The ideal or best credit card for you therefore would be the one that is tailored to your requirements in terms of your spending habits, lifestyle goals and the
                                        credit limit you are seeking. The ultimate aim is to optimise available rewards and benefits while also considering applicable fees and interest rates.</p><p>If you are a first time credit card holder, consider the following factors before choosing your credit card:</p><ul class="basicList"><li><strong>Monthly expenses:</strong><br/>Choose a credit card whose limit is close to your monthly expenses. If you have a lower credit limit, prioritise only the payments which should be made through your credit
                                            card.

                                        </li><li><strong>Rewards &amp; Points:</strong><br/>You could also select a credit card that offers certain additional benefits such as cashback and discounts on your purchases or complimentary access to airport lounges.
                                        </li><li><strong>Card control:</strong><br/>Choose the card issuer based on how easy it is to manage the credit card especially on the mobile app or website. You should be able to manage spend limit, international usage,
                                            set the PIN, view payment history &amp; statements, block &amp; replace card, among other features
                                        </li><li><strong>Card offers:</strong><br/>Apart from offers from brands and merchants, card issuers also offer other benefits such as converting spends into EMIs, availing instant loans, upgrading card limit, getting an
                                            add-on card for your family members, and much more
                                        </li><li><strong>Card fees and charges:</strong><br/>Credit cards will have slightly different interest rates depending on the issuer that offers the card. Therefore, always compare the fees and interest rates before you
                                            choose a credit card.

Additionally, you can set transaction limits using the “manage spends”
                                            feature for specific purchases on your credit card, making it easier for you to adhere to your spending objectives.</li><li><strong>Don’t use your entire credit card limit</strong><br/>Ideally you should aim for spending not more than 30% of your credit card limit. You can control your spending and avoid debt by doing so. </li><li><strong>Check credit card statements regularly</strong><br/>Regularly checking your statement helps you stay on top of your spending, ensure accurate billing, detect fraudulent activity and avoid late payment fees
                                            and interest charges.</li><li><strong>Pay your credit card bills on time</strong><br/>This helps you maintain a good credit score and avoid late payment fees and interest charges. You can also set up automatic payment or payment reminders to
                                            help you pay your bill before due date. You should also opt for paying your dues in full and not just the minimum amount due in order to avoid interest charges.</li><li><strong>Use your credit card points and offers</strong><br/>Using available offers and rewards is an excellent way to maximise the benefits of your credit card and save money on every purchase.
                                        </li></ol></div><span class="moreNless" data-event="event_CC_Page_on_click" data-eventaction="Read More Clicked" data-eventcategory="CC page - main body" data-eventlabel="Which is the best Credit Card for you" data-sf-ec-immutable="" onclick="gotoLink(this);">Read More</span>
