                        How to use a CHIP and PIN card:<br/>
                        Just like a magnetic stripe card, the CHIP and PIN enabled credit card too can be used at the merchant’s payment terminals directly. Instead of swiping the card, merchants need to ‘Dip’ your card into a CHIP reader slot.<br/>
                        Paying through CHIP and PIN enabled Credit Card is a 3-step process:
                    </p>

<li>Credit card is enabled with a chip and PIN facility, offering unrivalled protection</li>
<li>Chip is capable of storing and transacting data in an encrypted format and is encrypted with a PIN that is only known to the cardholder</li>
</ul>
<p>
                        How to use a CHIP and PIN card:<br/>
                        Just like a magnetic stripe card, the CHIP and PIN enabled credit card too can be used at the merchant’s payment terminals directly. Instead of swiping the card, merchants need to ‘Dip’ your card into a CHIP reader slot.<br/>
                        Paying through CHIP and PIN enabled Credit Card is a 3-step process:
                    </p>
<ul class="basicList">
<li>Dip/Swipe your card</li>
<li>Enter your ATM PIN</li>
<li>Sign on charge slip</li>
