<p>A brief overview of the work done across the three phases of the project is mentioned below. The blogs may be referred for a detailed explanation.</p>

<ol>
	<li>The first part of the project mainly comprised of shifting the scripts from the <a href="https://github.com/weecology/retriever">retriever</a> repository to the new <a href="https://github.com/weecology/retriever-recipes">retriever-recipes</a> repository. The other major task was moving the script adding and editing functionalities to the recipes repository. For doing so, necessary changes also needed to be done in the retriever repository.</li>

	<li>Previously, Retriever would only look at the local scripts when needed to install or use a dataset. The goal of the second phase of the project was to enable downloading the scripts from upstream if not present locally. Later, I worked on the task of always attempting to use the latest version of scripts when installing or using a dataset.</li>

	<li>In the last phase of the project, I made the necessary changes to the two Retriever wrapper repositories: <a href="https://github.com/weecology/Retriever.jl">Retriever.jl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/weecology/rdataretriever">rdataretriever</a>. Apart from it, I opened pull requests for getting things merged into the master branch from the current development. I also performed exhaustive checking for errors in documentation and code.</li>
</ol>

<p>During the course of the project, I mainly contributed to two repositories: retriever and retriever-recipes. The list of commits made in the two repositories:</p>

<ul>
	<li>retriever: https://github.com/weecology/retriever/commits?author=harshitbansal05</li>
	<li>retriever-recipes: https://github.com/weecology/retriever-recipes/commits?author=harshitbansal05</li>
</ul>

<p>The list of major pull requests made for the project:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/weecology/retriever/pull/1381">GSoC: Add provenance and recipes</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/weecology/retriever-recipes/pull/26">Merge retriever-recipes-dev into master</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rdataretriever/pull/193">Make appropriate changes for recipes features</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/weecology/Retriever.jl/pull/51">Make changes corresponding to retriever</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I also wrote a number of blogs writing about the work done, on a bi-weekly basis. The list of the blogs written for the GSoC project so far:</p>
