<p>Hello,</p>

<p>The first two weeks of the coding period are over. Hereâ€™s a peek into what I have done in the past two weeks.</p>

<p>The first two weeks of my proposal mainly comprised of shifting the scripts from the `retriever` repository to the new `retriever-recipes` repository. The other major task was moving the script adding and editing functionalities to the new `retriever-recipes` repository. For doing so, necessary changes also needed to be done in the `retriever` repository. I have opened two pull-requests in both the repositories, and they are currently in testing and review phase. I hope them to get merged soon.</p>
