<p>Hello,</p>

<p>The first two weeks of the coding period are over. Hereâ€™s a peek into what I have done in the past two weeks.</p>

<p>The first two weeks of my proposal mainly comprised of shifting the scripts from the <code>retriever</code> repository to the new <code>retriever-recipes</code> repository. The other major task was moving the script adding and editing functionalities to the new <code>retriever-recipes</code> repository. For doing so, necessary changes also needed to be done in the <code>retriever</code> repository.</p>

<p>Their was some discussion needed regarding the mvoing of scripts. Andrew, one of the mentors was of the view that some scripts should be present in retriever to give the users an idea of the json scripts. Thus, keeping this in mind, we came to the decision that we would assign five scripts (the most stable and the oldest) as the "retriever legacy scripts", keeping them in retriever. The rest of the scripts would be moved to the recipes repository.</p>
 
<p>I have opened four pull-requests for the above tasks, two each in both of the repositories, and they are currently in testing and review phase. I hope them to get merged soon.</p>
